Ryan’s depth of knowledge, tenacious research, and detail-oriented thinking always made for a learning opportunity, good debate, and led to making well-designed products.</p><p>You can always count on Ryan’s keen observations to uncover issues and he always offers creative solutions to address his findings. Ryan is a team-player, taking time to help colleagues whether they’re struggling with devops or need some advice on CSS best practices-he’s always willing to help. Ryan would be a great addition to any team in many capacities. Working with him is one of the things I miss most about not being at E-Trade.</p>"
